Description of Installation
Part a) The first step is to install the Keil uVision integrated development environment (IDE) for the ARM. 
        This IDE includes the editor, compiler, simulator, and debugger. 
        The MDK-Lite (32KB) Edition does not require a serial number or license key.

Part b) The second step is install Test EXecute and Simulate (TExaS). 
        TExaS is a set of enhancements to Keil that will serve as your helper and grader during this course. 
         This installation will also setup the example projects and starter files for labs.

Part c) The third step will be to install the hardware device drivers for your LaunchPad. 
        You will need the LaunchPad hardware to perform this step. 
        If you do not have it yet or do not plan to buy the hardware kit, you can skip this step and perform the labs in simulation.
